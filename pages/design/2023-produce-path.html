<h2>FM Tracks Daily Data</h2>

<p>
	To help market managers enter daily data, I designed and built a new interface that surfaces
	important data points and allows managers to visually get a sense of the market data available in
	a given month.
</p>
<p>To build this, a blend data is needed from</p>
<ul>
	<li>market hours,</li>
	<li>market limited hours,</li>
	<li>market transactions,</li>
	<li>market reimbursements, and</li>
	<li>market post-market reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	At this time, I finally decided to pick up <em>Envisioning Information</em> by Edward R. Tufte. I
	used the book to help me design the Daily Data interface and it specifically influenced the
	inclusion of sparklines for transactions and reimbursements.
</p>

<h2>FM Tracks Quick Search</h2>

<h2>FM Engage Proximity Map</h2>

<p>To help market consumers see market locations, I built a market proximity map.</p>
<p>Market consumers can specify a location to search or use their current location.</p>

<h2>Penelope, the Produce Path Tomato</h2>

<p>
	To help onboard people to the platform, I introduced <em>Penelope, the Produce Path Tomato</em>.
</p>
<p>Penelope shows up whenever I think people might benefit from more information.</p>
<p>These include</p>
<ul>
	<li>On the Engage Inventory page, to note that the inventory is an estimate.</li>
	<li>On the Engage Vendors page, to note that the vendors are an estimate.</li>
	<li>On the Tracks Banner, to welcome people to the new interface.</li>
	<li>
		On the Tracks Daily Data page, to answer “What do the colors mean?” and “Why isn’t my data
		showing up?” and explains them kindly.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>More fun</h2>

<p>
	When a market manager updates a vendors inventory, a toast message appears with a message like
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Way to grow!</li>
	<li>Farmtastic!</li>
	<li>Market magic unlocked!</li>
	<li>Delicious!</li>
	<li>Harvest happiness!</li>
	<li>Crop-tastic!</li>
	<li>Fresh and fabulous!</li>
	<li>Flavor fiesta!</li>
</ul>
