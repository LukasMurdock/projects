<h1>Marketing</h1>

<p>
	I grew up in an internet age. As a young boy, I would watch self-taught practitioners produce
	short videos and share their thinking and learnings, I grew fascinated with cinematography, and
	devoured the breakdowns of scenes and productions.
</p>
<p>
	Building on the web brought me to dive deep into SEO (Search Engine Optimization), which brought
	me to dive deep into marketing. Author, entrepreneur and teacher Seth Godin showed me effective
	marketing and leadership, how ideas spread and how the culture changes everything.
</p>
<p>
	Marketers understand the feelings of those they seek to serve and look to serve them better. Aside
	from the actual need-to-buy category, what we buy isn’t products. We buy emotional change.
</p>
<p>
	Marketing is about gaining trust, showing the people you seek to serve the benefit and advantage
	in outcomes they can expect from doing business with you. It’s being able to speak to people in
	ways no-one else has.
