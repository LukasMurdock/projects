<h1>Marketing</h1>

<p>
	Marketers understand the feelings of those they seek to serve and look to serve them better. Aside
	from the actual need-to-buy category, what we buy isn’t products. We buy emotional change.
</p>
<p>
	Marketing is about gaining trust, showing the people you seek to serve the benefit and advantage
	in outcomes they can expect from doing business with you. It’s being able to speak to people in
	ways no-one else has.
