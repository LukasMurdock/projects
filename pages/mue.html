<h1>Miami University Explorer</h1>

<p>
	Miami University Explorer is a web application build to explore buildings and courses at Miami
	University. I built this project from scratch with Remix, Tailwind, Prisma, and SQLite.

<h2>Stack decisions</h2>

<p>
	I knew I wanted to use JSX to template, Tailwind to style, and Prisma for the ORM. I initially
	explored using Deno for this project, but it lacked Prisma support at the time. I choose to learn
	more about Remix, “focused on web standards and modern web app UX”.
