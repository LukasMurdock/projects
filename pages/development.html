<h1>Development</h1>

<p>
	Programmers help people understand what they want. We write code that solves complex problems
	through a lucid interface for others to build upon.
</p>
<p>
	By doing what works, and not whatâ€™s fashionable. By writing code specific to the problem at hand
	while on the lookout for abstractions. By shipping often. By seeking to understand more about the
	code written.
