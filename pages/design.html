<h1>Design</h1>

<p>
	As I built custom lock screens for my iPhone in middle school, I came across the works of Luke
	Wroblewski online—Product Director at Google. His thoughts and reports on mobile and web
	usability, interaction, and visual design drastically shaped how I think about mobile and web
	design.
</p>
<p>
	Wroblewski’s reports carefully laid out various usability tests of products at Google and how they
	learned that what they had thought was good design interface, was not. He covered new pitfalls of
	mobile and web design, as at the time the landscape was drastically changing.
</p>
<p>
	On Tuesday, November 27, 2018 I saw the Columbus Premiere Screening of “Rams” hosted by director
	Gary Hustwit, presented by the Wexner Center for the Arts. <em>Rams</em> is a documentary portrait
	of Dieter Rams, one of the most influential designers alive, and a rumination on consumerism,
	sustainability, and the future of design.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Rams</em> showed me how—amidst an impenetrable confusion of forms, colors, and noises—good
	design can persist.
