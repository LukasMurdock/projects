<p>
	To become the new maintainers of Produce Path, SKYCATCHFIRE was rewriting a legacy ASP.NET/Angular
	web application to Next.js and the mobile application to React Native.

<p>Produce Path is a mobile and web application that combines FM Tracks and FM Engage.</p>
<h2>What is FM Tracks?</h2>
<p>
	FM Tracks is designed for managers operating direct-to-consumer markets. For example, farmers
	markets, mobile markets, or Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs.
</p>
<p>
	Managers use FM Tracks to collect data on sales, customers, and vendors at the market for personal
	accounting and year-to-year comparisons they can share with advisory boards, funders, and the
	general public.
</p>
<p>
	The Network feature of FM Tracks allows for all markets connected through a Network to share data
	collected via FM Tracks with a central Network Manager.
</p>
<p>
	FM Tracks is
	<a href="https://snaped.fns.usda.gov/library/materials/fm-tracks"
		>included in the US Department of Agriculture SNAP-Ed Toolkit</a
	>.
</p>
<h2>What is FM Engage?</h2>
<p>FM Engage allows market consumers to see market locations, hours, and potential offerings.</p>

<h2>Mid-port Authentication</h2>

<p>
	The authentication in this project was a challenge. The legacy application used ASP.NET for the
	auth, but the new application required AWS Cognito. Because the legacy application was still in
	use by the new application for some application logic, the new application had to do a complex
	dance between
</p>
<ul>
	<li>the browser,</li>
	<li>the Legacy App API,</li>
	<li>the Database, and</li>
	<li>AWS Cognito.</li>
</ul>

<p>Figuring this out required a few rewrites of the auth logic.</p>

<h2>FM Tracks Daily Data</h2>

<p>
	To help market managers enter daily data, I designed and built a new interface that surfaces
	important data points and allows managers to visually get a sense of the market data available in
	a given month.
</p>
<p>To build this, a blend data is needed from</p>
<ul>
	<li>market hours,</li>
	<li>market limited hours,</li>
	<li>market transactions,</li>
	<li>market reimbursements, and</li>
	<li>market post-market reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	As this project was a port of an existing application, I poured over the legacy code to determine
	how things worked. I then designed new HTTP API interfaces to support the new interface and
	implemented them in the Next.js API routes.
</p>
<p>
	To keep people moving fast, I used React Query to keep any given months data around locally for
	five minutes.
</p>

<h2>FM Tracks Quick Search</h2>

<p>
	At any given time, a market manager may need to quickly find a organization, network, or market.
	To support this, I built a quick search feature that maintains a client side list of
	organizations, networks, and markets and allows the user to search through them.
</p>

<h2>FM Engage Proximity Map</h2>

<p>To help market consumers see market locations, I built a market proximity map.</p>
<p>
	Market consumers can specify a location to search, or use their current location using the
	Geolocation API. If they specify a location to search it will be converted to latitude and
	longitude coordinates using the Google Geocoding API. An upper and lower bound latitude and
	longitude is calculated from an approximation of a 25 mile radius the simple approximation of 1
	degree of latitude being 69 miles and 1 degree of longitude being 69 miles at the equator and 0
	miles at the poles. The upper and lower bound latitude and longitude is then used to query the
	database for markets within the approximate 25 mile radius.
</p>
<p>The map is built with Google Maps and the Google Maps JavaScript API.</p>
