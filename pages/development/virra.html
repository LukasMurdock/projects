<h1>Virra Marketing</h1>

<p>
	This project was my first production web app—a new marketing website for Virra Marketing and a web
	application to test new software services.

<h2>Stack decisions</h2>

<p>
	Virra had already integrated with Firestore as a database. Next.js seemed a good option as a
	frontend framework, with its file-based routing, API routes, wonderful documentation, and large
	backing. Although admittedly, at the time I had not the comparative knowledge to articulate what
	the tradeoffs of Next.js are. Vercel, the company behind Next.js, was then the clear choice as a
	hosting provider.
</p>

<p>
	Next.js leans towards client-side over server-side. The documentation goes so far to explicitly
	recommend fetching data client side. Vercel maintains a “React Hooks for Data Fetching” library
	called SWR for client side fetching.
</p>

<p>
	Next.js provides an integrated file-based routing for creating API routes. Behind the scenes,
	Vercel utilizes AWS Lambda functions to handle the API routes.
</p>

<h2>Lessons</h2>

<p>
	As the first production web app, I learned a great deal about web applications with this project.
	I dove into React and Node, with Next.js and Firestore as a helpful buffer in “serverless”
	architecture.
