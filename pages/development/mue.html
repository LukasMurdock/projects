<p>
	Miami University Explorer is a web application build to explore buildings and courses at Miami
	University. I built this project from scratch with Remix, Tailwind, Prisma, and SQLite.

<dl>
	<dt>Stack</dt>
	<dd>Remix.js</dd>
	<dd>SQLite</dd>
	<dd>Prisma</dd>
	<dd>Docker, Fly.io</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Stack decisions</h2>

<p>
	I wanted to use this project to explore Deno (pronounced Deeno). My original plan was the
	following stack.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Deno</li>
	<li>SQLite</li>
	<li>Hugo</li>
	<li>Tufte.css</li>
	<li>Autocomplete.js</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Deno and SQLite would index the courses and buildings. Hugo would quickly build every page I
	wanted upfront. Tufte.css would handle all styling through semantic HTML. And Autocomplete.js
	would enable searching for courses with a text input.
</p>

<p>
	I knew I wanted to use JSX to template, Tailwind to style, and Prisma for the ORM. I initially
	explored using Deno for this project, but it lacked Prisma support at the time. I choose to learn
	more about Remix, “focused on web standards and modern web app UX”.
</p>

<h2>Lessons</h2>

<p>
	I explored the Miami APIs and created all the API functions in TypeScript with Deno. This
	exploration gave a great deal of learnings as Deno is webby—it implements standard web APIs, so,
	when you get better at Deno, you get better at the web. And I learned about:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Transport Layer Security</li>
	<li>Stream API</li>
	<li>User Timing API</li>
	<li>Transfer-Encoding HTTP Headers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transport Layer Security</h3>

<p>
	Trying to fetch the academic terms endpoint in Deno threw an <code>HandshakeFailure error</code>.
	I found out, Deno does not support weak ciphers. And this server is using an old insecure TLS
	version that Deno refuses to accept.
</p>
<p>
	I don’t know anything about TLS handshakes or ciphers. But running
	<code>curl -v https://ws.miamioh.edu/api/academic/banner/v2/academicTerms/current</code> gave this
	message
</p>
<p>
	<code>
		// SSL connection using TLSv1.2 / AES256-SHA256<br />
		// ALPN, server did not agree to a protocol
	</code>
</p>
<p>I came across SSL Labs and ran a test</p>

<p>I learned about Newline delimited JSON (ndjson).</p>
