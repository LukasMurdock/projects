<p>
	ProVia manufactures professional-class doors, windows, vinyl-siding, manufactured stone, and metal
	roofing for residential and non-residential use.
</p>
<p>
	ProVia wanted a more easy-to-use CMS for their marketing website that showcases their products and
	a better Vision Board and Where to Buy implementation.
</p>
<p>I had never worked with direct WordPress development before, so I had a lot to learn.</p>

<h2>Design Center: Vision Board</h2>

<p>
	Across the website, account members can favorite images. The vision board allows members to create
	boards with their favorite images in a masonry grid with item actions
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Edit selection</li>
	<li>Edit position</li>
	<li>Edit ratio</li>
	<li>Move left</li>
	<li>Move right</li>
	<li>Insert left</li>
	<li>Insert right</li>
	<li>Remove</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I built the vision board with plain JavaScript, Tailwind, and custom WordPress Data API endpoints.
	I had to patch html2canvas to save the Vision Board as an image.
</p>

<h2>Dealer Locations: Where to Buy</h2>

<p>
	ProVia wanted to make it easier for customers to find where to buy their products. I built a
	custom WordPress Data API endpoint to return a list of ProVia dealers. Customers can filter for
	dealers that provide specific product categories, dealers that have certain features (e.g.,
	visualization), and a zipcode. I used Alpine.js to handle the state management of the search form
	and results. The map is built with Google Maps and the Google Maps JavaScript API.
